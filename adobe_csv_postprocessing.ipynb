      "Which persons are insured? \n",
      "26\n",
      "In the case of insurance policies with a term of less than one year (short-term insurance policies), the persons listed in the insurance policy are insured. In the event of insurance policies with a term of one year (annual insurance policies), the insurance policy states whether the insurance cover applies for the policyholder alone (single person) or for the policyholder and the persons living with him/her in the same household as well as their minor children not living in the same household (family insurance policy). \n",

      "30\n",
      "What are the main exclusions? \n",
      "31\n",
      "The following list contains only the most important insurance cover exclusions. The exclusionary clauses Â«Non-insured events and benefitsÂ» of the General Terms and Conditions of Insurance as well as the ICA contain further exclusions: \n",
      "32\n",
      "âˆ’ \n",
      "33\n",
      "It is essentially the case that all insurance components do not provide insurance cover for events that had already occurred by the time of the signing of the contract, the booking of the journey or the commencement of the booked service; the same applies to events whose occurrence was recognisable at the time of the signing of the contract, the booking of the journey or the commencement of the booked service. \n",
      "34\n",
      "âˆ’ \n",
      "35\n",
      "Furthermore, there is no cover for such events as abuse of alcohol, drugs or medicines, suicide or attempted suicide, participation in strikes or unrest, participation in races or training sessions with motor vehicles or boats, participation in adventurous acts whereby the entitled person knowingly exposes him/herself to danger, negligent or premeditated actions/or failure to act. \n",

      "How much is the premium? \n",
      "49\n",
      "The amount of the premium depends on the risks insured and stipulated level of cover. The amount of the premium is defined with the application and results from the insurance policy. \n",

      "When does the insurance begin and end? \n",
      "51\n",
      "The beginning and end of the insurance are defined in the application and detailed in the insurance policy. \n",
      "52\n",
